And then we came across, the plastic wastes, the non-degradable property of plastics, and the non-availability of recycling infrastructure in most developing countries. 
        <p>Our goal also was that the volunteers that volunteer in working towards reducing plastics, must be rewarded.</p>
        <p>Summing these ideas up, we have come up with a Plastic Bank that aims to reduce all sorts of plastic waste while reducing poverty.</p>
        <p>By enabling the exchange of all sorts of plastic for the cryptocurrency tokens that are safe and secured and are completely dependent on the market value, they become too valuable to be thrown away.</p>
        <p>These plastics collected shall be sent to the recycling team and sold as Social Plastics at premium rates. This empowers the recycling ecosystem and also enables local entrepreneurs to set up and operate their own Plastic Bank branch as a fully supported franchise.</p>
